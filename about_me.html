    Hi! I'm a recent graduate from the Uni of Bristol, currently searching for jobs. I started the codenation course to try to gain a new
    skill which will hopefully help me in later life. I have a range of different hobbies which include; gaming ((J)RPGs mostly), reading about international relations
    and I'm also into quite a few sports. A few of these are pretty unconventional as I'm both a competitive powerlifter
    and a competitive ballroom dancer, for my dance profile, you can Click <a href="https://dancesportinfo.net/Couple/Peter_Emecheta_and_Katie_Deverson_383548/Details"target="_ blank">here</a>
