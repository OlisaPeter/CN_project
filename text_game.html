    <h1><p class ="p2">Python Project<p></h1>
    <p class="p1">As part of my course on Codenation, I had to do two projects. One is the website
        that you're currently on and the other was a group python project.
        This was in the form of a text-based adventure game which we decided to name "To infinity and beyond!" If you'd like to try it, it's embedded
        to this page, do note that some of the text was cut off by trinket.io though. Click "Run" to begin the game!
